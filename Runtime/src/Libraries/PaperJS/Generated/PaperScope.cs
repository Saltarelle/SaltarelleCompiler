    /// The PaperScope class represents the scope associated with a Paper context. When working with PaperScript, these scopes are automatically created for us, and through clever scoping the properties and methods of the active scope seem to become part of the global scope. When working with normal JavaScript code, PaperScope objects need to be manually created and handled. Paper classes can only be accessed through PaperScope objects. Thus in PaperScript they are global, while in JavaScript, they are available on the global paper object. For JavaScript you can use paperScope.install(scope) to install the Paper classes and objects on the global scope. Note that when working with more than one scope, this still works for classes, but not for objects like paperScope.project, since they are not updated in the injected scope if scopes are switched. The global paper object is simply a reference to the currently active PaperScope.

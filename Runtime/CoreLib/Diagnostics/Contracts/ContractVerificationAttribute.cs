	/// Can use [ContractVerification(false)] to explicitly mark assembly, type or member as one to *not* have verification performed on it.
	/// Most specific element found (member, type, then assembly) takes precedence.

	/// Apply this attribute to an assembly to apply to all types and members of the assembly.
	/// Apply this attribute to a property to apply to both the getter and setter.

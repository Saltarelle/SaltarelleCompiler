	/// <summary>
	/// Instructs downstream tools whether to assume the correctness of this assembly, type or member without performing any verification or not.
	/// Can use [ContractVerification(false)] to explicitly mark assembly, type or member as one to *not* have verification performed on it.
	/// Most specific element found (member, type, then assembly) takes precedence.
	/// (That is useful if downstream tools allow a user to decide which polarity is the default, unmarked case.)
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Apply this attribute to a type to apply to all members of the type, including nested types.
	/// Apply this attribute to an assembly to apply to all types and members of the assembly.
	/// Apply this attribute to a property to apply to both the getter and setter.
	/// </remarks>

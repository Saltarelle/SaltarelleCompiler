2.5.0
Awaiting a task throws the inner exception rather than the AggregateException of the task, as in .net (#294).
Created a [BackingFieldName] attribute that can be used to specify the name of the backing field for an automatically implemented property or event.
BREAKING CHANGE: [IntrinsicProperty] no longer implies [PreserveName]
Added a [CustomInitializationAttribute] that allows custom initialization to be specified for fields (including the backing fields of properties and events)
Fixed issue with Object.keys being used before it was defined on browsers that don't support it natively (or if a polyfill was already included) (#276)
BREAKING CHANGE: Removed Array.prototype.filter, forEach and every from mscorlib. Use some other polyfill if you need these (#276).

Support escaped braces ({{, }}) in format strings (#252)
Added possibility to embed resources in the generated script (Assembly.GetManifestResourceNames, Assembly.GetManifestResourceData).
Added Environment.NewLine
Added methods Convert.FromBase64String and Convert.ToBase64String
BREAKING CHANGE: Type.GetType("TypeName, AssemblyName") will now only scan loaded assemblies. Additional assemblies can be loaded using Assembly.Load(). Type.GetType("TypeName") works like before.

Integer division by zero will now throw DivideByZeroException.
Removed (actually: obsoleted as errors) the Script# reflection methods. Some of the functionality can now be found in the Script class, but some was just removed.
Type system now supports interface variance (eg. IMyInterface<in T1, out T2>).
Use real prototype inheritance instead of the homegrown __baseType hack.
Ensured .NET semantics for String.Split methods that take a limit argument (#229). The JS semantics can be found in methods called JsSplit. This might cause compilation errors, but it will not silently break any code.
Fixed TimeSpan.Zero (#227)
Added [DefaultMemberReflectabilityAttribute] to specify which members are reflectable by default (#180)
Added types Stopwatch and IFormatProvider, and added some overloads of String.Split (thanks to Marcel F)

Fixed problem with base types not being initialized before derived types in certain cases including generic types in the chain (#222)
Custom class attributes no longer need to qualify nested classes (#224)
Fixed issues with double and float constants misbehaving in minified scripts (#208)
NoInlineAttribute can now be applied to const fields to prevent them from being inlined in minified scripts.
BREAKING CHANGE: double.MinValue now returns the value expected in .net (approx -1.7e-308) instead of the one in JS (Number.MIN_VALUE = 5e-324). JsMinValue exists to return Number.MIN_VALUE.
Allow statements (any number of them) in inline code for methods returning void (#149)

Make sure additional files are copied to the output directory in order to avoid unnecessary rebuilds (#172).
Fixed bug in the 'C' number format.
All constructors for [Imported] types are now treated as unnamed constructors unless a [ScriptName] is specified for them (#164).
Applying a [ScriptNameAttribute] to an [Imported] enum will now cause the fields of the enum to be treated as field access on the type (#160).

2.1.0
Added class HttpUtility
It is now an error to use the 'is' and 'as' operators with types that don't obey the type system.
Allow parameters for ObjectLiteral constructors to be a type derived from the initialized member or a non-nullable version of a nullable member.

Added types System.TimeSpan, System.Random (thanks to Marcel F)
Implemented support for expression trees.
Interfaces can now be serializable (#106)
BREAKING CHANGE: Math.Round now uses C# semantics (RoundToEven). To get JS semantics (round up), use Math.JsRound.
ScriptSkipAttribute can now be specified to constructors to indicate that the constructor call will be skipped when used as a constructor initializer (": base()" or ": this()")
More .net string and Math methods (thanks to Marcel F)
Implemented .net reflection API (#125)
Support [InlineCode] on property accessors on serializable types

Fixed issue causing internal errors when compiling async methods with certain constructs.
Added IncludeGenericArgumentsDefaultAttribute to specify default values for IncludeGenericArguments in an assembly.
Added IncludeGenericArgumentsAttribute and removed IgnoreGenericArgumentsAttribute. For the IgnoreGenericArguments effect, use IncludeGenericArguments(false).
Use Object.Equals() in ICollection methods Contains, IndexOf, Remove of collections and arrays.
mscorlib.js no longer extends any built-in object. The only global pollution is a single global object called 'ss'.
    This is a breaking change for manually written Javascript that depends on mscorlib, but should not affect compiled code.
BREAKING CHANGE: System.DateTime now uses one-based months. System.JsDate uses zero-based months (#116)
BREAKING CHANGE: String.Substring now matches .net semantics (start/count). If you want JS semantics (start/end), use String.JsSubstring (#117).

Don't swallow exceptions in async void methods.
Fixed assigning to the backing field of an event.
Fixed issue using async methods in certain cases when not using the VS .targets file.

1.5.1
Fixed issue using "this" in async methods.

1.5.0
Added Support for AMD (AsyncModuleAttribute)
Added support for generating executables, which will invoke the static Main entry point (command line -t:exe, task property TargetType).
Allow invalid identifiers in [ScriptName] and similar attribute. This will generate indexing expressions rather than dot-notation for those members.
foreach over ElementCollection and List<T> will now use a for loop. The [EnumerateAsArrayAttribute] controls this behaviour.
Casting undefined to another type now returns undefined (instead of throwing an error).
Can now specify PreseveMemberCase(false) on types to ignore the effect of a PreserveMemberCaseAttribute on the assembly.
Node.js support: mscorlib works in Node, and there is a Node.js import library.
Allow members other than methods in [GlobalMethods] classes. All members in such classes will be treated as gloabls (or module globals).

Fixed problem invoking method on a class decorated with a [MixinAttribute].
Fixed compilation of expression lambda containing a single property assignment.

Conditional expressions now only declare the temporary variable once.
Ensure that the RHS of a coalescing operator is not evaluated if the LHS is null
Added support for [ExpandParams] and [BindThisToFirstParameter] attributes on delegates.

1.2.5
Refactored the handling of inline code. This means that unnecessary parentheses should no longer appear when using certain methods. It also means that the {,arg} modifier is removed ({*arg} now knows what to do), and inline code is verified to be syntactically valid.
Re-added types Queue<T> and Stack<T> to the RTL

1.2.4
ImportedAttribute now also counts as IgnoreGenericArgument by default (Script# compatibility issue).
Fixed an issue causing object initializers to be ignored for constructors defined as inline code.
Fixed issue causing enum fields not to be included in the enum type.

1.2.3
Fixed metadata bug causing jQuery.ExtendXX methods not to work
Added a PreserveMemberCaseAttribute that can be used to prevent camel-casing of members in an assembly or a type.

1.2.2

1.2.0
Fixed compiling instance methods on serializable types.
Insert parentheses around number when a member is being accessed (eg. (1).member).
Removed implicit conversion of char to string because that caused issues with csc. Added error message when char is boxed because this is very unlikely to yield undesired behaviour.
Serializable types no longer have to be sealed (but they still cannot use virtual/override)
Fixed issue with Visual Studio IntelliSense
Fixed issue that causes s.IndexOf("x", 1) to be compiled to s.indexOf(String.fromCharCode('/'), 1)
Fixed issue using static members through subclasses of the declaring type.
Added new assembly-level ScriptSharpCompatibiliyAttribute.
Added equality and inequality operators to System.DateTime.
Some fixes to System.String

1.1.4
Fixed NuGet dependency versions. Installing Runtime will now always install the latest version of the compiler and so on.

1.1.3
Fixed issue cloning generic delegates (eg. Func, Action).

1.1.2
Fixed issue causing incorrect code to be generated when duplicate using directives were specified. Also added code to ensure an internal error is raised under similar circumstances.
RegexMatch has a Length property and is convertible to string[]
DateTime.ParseExact and ParseExactUtc metadata updated to return DateTime? (which they always actually have in script)

1.1.1
Added type NotSupportedException (required for the iterator blocks feature).

1.1.0
Use !! for dynamic conversions to bool.
Fixed internal error when implementing properties/events that are [NonScriptable]
Implemented support for iterator blocks (yield)

1.0.0
Initial version
